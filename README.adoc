= Skaffold Quarkus Hello World
:experimental:

A demo to show how to use https://https://skaffold.dev/[Skaffold] with https://quarkus.io[Quarkus] developer mode to enable rapid Java application with Kubernetes.

== Pre-requisites

* https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/[minikube]
* http://openjdk.java.net/install/[Java 8]
* https://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven]
* https://https://skaffold.dev/[Skaffold]
* https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker] (Optional)

== Setup Kubernetes Cluster

[source,bash]
----
minikube profile quarkus-demos
minikube start -p quarkus-demos --memory=8192 --cpus=4 --disk-size=50g #<1>
----

<1> Please add the other needed options as per your operating system

== Setup Nexus(Optional)

We will use nexus for caching maven artifacts so that builds are faster.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f k8s/nexus.yaml
----

Wait for some time to have nexus initialize and run. You can watch the status via `kubectl get pods -w`, use kbd:[Ctrl+c] to terminate the watch

== Run Skaffold

[source,bash]
----
skaffold dev --port-forward #<1>
----
<1> Run skaffold in `dev` mode. The **port-forward** option automatically foward the kubernetes service port(default is 8080) to localhost port (default is 8080). By default it maps the application service port `8080` to host `8080`

[NOTE]
====
* The first build will be bit slower as it needs to cache the maven artifacts in nexus maven repository
* You can watch the status via `kubectl get pods -w `, use kbd:[Ctrl+c] to terminate the watch
====

Once you see your application running alongside nexus (if you had deployed earlier):

[source,bash]
----
NAME                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nexus-5585f7fcf6-jk6j7                         1/1     Running   0          5h3m
skaffold-quarkus-helloworld-6f99cbb648-lsqwh   1/1     Running   0          5s
----

Try opening the url http://locahost:8080/hello, which should show a message like **Welcome to Quarkus!!** from the link:./src/main/java/com/redhat/developers/GreetingResource.java#L14[GreetingResource.java]

Now make any changes to the sources in your editor and try refreshing the browser you will see Quarkus live reload happening as usual on the terminal where you had started `skaffold dev` without the `skaffold-quarkus-hello-world` redeployed.

[TIP]
====
Though the demo application provides `build.cmd` for windows users I personally recommend https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10[WSL] and https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview[VS Code Remote Development]
